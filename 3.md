|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Features**         | - Offers more control and flexibility than ScannerJS. <br> - Supports document viewer, document rotation, barcode scan, and more. <br> - Easier to customize for specific use cases. | - Fewer features but works right out of the box. <br> - Handles basic scanning like multiple pages, duplex, etc. <br> - Not ideal for fine-grained control. | - Dynamsoft is better if you want advanced control, but it requires more setup and dev time. <br> - ScannerJS is simpler.    |
| **Performance**      | - Still collecting feedback from users with scanners to evaluate performance fully.                                                            | - Also waiting for user feedback to compare scan speed, image clarity, and file sizes.                                                               | - Performance testing still pending on both.                                                                                 |
| **Ease of Integration** | - Slightly more work to integrate, but we were able to re-use some ScannerJS code. <br> - Integration with Angular needed a few fixes.             | - Very quick and smooth integration. <br> - Fewer customizations but easier to get started.                                                           | - ScannerJS is easier to get running fast. <br> - Dynamsoft offers more control once it's fully integrated.                  |
| **Platform Support** | - Works on Windows and Mac. <br> - Supports major browsers.                                                                                   | - Only supports Windows.                                                                                                                              | - Dynamsoft wins for broader platform compatibility.                                                                         |
| **Licensing**        | - Many pricing models: <br> ‣ Per Device <br> ‣ Per Barcode Scan <br> ‣ Per Concurrent User <br> ‣ Per Server <br> ‣ Per Scanner              | - More expensive: <br> ‣ Professional Light Traffic: ~$1,500 <br> ‣ Professional Medium Traffic: ~$2,000 <br> ‣ Professional High Traffic: ~$4,000 <br> ‣ Enterprise Light: ~$20,000 <br> ‣ Enterprise Medium: ~$40,000 | - ScannerJS licensing is surprisingly costly. <br> - Dynamsoft offers more flexible pricing depending on use case.           |
| **Security**         | - Offers documentation and features around security. <br> - Still verifying if it's approved by internal security team.                        | - Offers general security but limited documentation. <br> - Approval from security is also pending.                                                  | - Both need security team confirmation. <br> - Dynamsoft seems more transparent about its security offerings.                |
| **Overall Impressions** | - Dynamsoft feels more powerful overall. <br> - Setup takes longer but offers a lot more flexibility. <br> - Still a few missing "quick features". | - Developers found docs a bit unclear. <br> - Simple tasks worked well, but some scanning modes were not reliable.                                     | - Dynamsoft is better long-term for advanced needs. <br> - ScannerJS was faster to test, but felt limiting quickly.          |
