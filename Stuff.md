# **Spike Story: Azure Entra ID Authentication and Authorization with MFA in Azure Government Cloud**

## **1. Objective**
The goal of this spike is to research, design, and document a solution for implementing **MFA-enabled authentication and role-based authorization** using **Azure Entra ID** (formerly Azure AD) within the **Azure Government Cloud** environment. The solution must avoid dependencies on third-party platforms like **Auth0** or **Okta**.

This document will guide the team through the configuration and setup necessary to authenticate users, enforce **MFA**, and implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** for .NET 8+ microservices.

---

## **2. Key Requirements**
- Implement **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** for authentication.
- Enforce **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** via **Azure Entra ID**.
- No dependencies on third-party identity providers (such as Auth0 or Okta).
- Configure the solution to work on **Azure Government Cloud**.
- Support role-based authorization to restrict access to resources based on user roles.
- Provide documentation on configuration and deployment in **Azure Government Cloud**.

---

## **3. Prerequisites**
1. **Azure Government Cloud Subscription**: Access to an Azure Government environment with necessary privileges to manage Azure Entra ID and create App Registrations.
2. **Azure Entra ID (Azure AD)**: Ensure MFA policies are enabled via **Conditional Access**.
3. **.NET 8+ SDK**: Install the latest .NET SDK on your development machine.
4. **Visual Studio 2022**: For developing and testing the solution.
5. **Azure App Registration**: Set up an application registration in **Azure Government Cloud** for authentication and token handling.

---

## **4. Technical Solution**

### **4.1 Architecture Overview**

1. **Client**: The client (browser or mobile app) will interact with a .NET 8+ microservice.
2. **Azure Entra ID**: Used for user authentication, enforcing MFA policies, and issuing access tokens.
3. **Microservices**: .NET 8+ web application (or API) with authentication and authorization middleware for RBAC.
4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Authorization to control access to resources based on the user's assigned roles in **Azure Entra ID**.

---

### **4.2 Detailed Steps**

#### **Step 1: Register Application in Azure Entra ID (Azure AD)**
1. **Create App Registration** in **Azure Government Cloud**:
   - Navigate to **Azure Entra ID > App Registrations**.
   - Click on **New Registration** and fill in the details:
     - **Name**: Provide a descriptive name for the application.
     - **Redirect URI**: Set `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc` for local development or your production redirect URI.
   - Record the **Client ID**, **Tenant ID**, and **Client Secret** for later use.

2. **Configure API Permissions**:
   - Under the **API Permissions** tab, add the necessary delegated permissions (such as `User.Read` for Microsoft Graph).
   - Grant **Admin Consent** for the permissions.
   
3. **Expose API** (Optional):
   - Define roles under **App Roles** and assign them to users or groups.

4. **Conditional Access Policy**:
   - In **Azure Entra ID > Security > Conditional Access**, create a policy that enforces **MFA** for all users logging into the app.

#### **Step 2: Update Configuration for Azure Government Cloud**

Update the **appsettings.json** to reflect **Azure Government** endpoints:

```json
{
  "AzureAd": {
    "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.us/",
    "Domain": "<tenant-name>.onmicrosoft.com",
    "TenantId": "<tenant-id>",
    "ClientId": "<client-id>",
    "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc",
    "ClientSecret": "<client-secret>",
    "Scopes": "openid profile offline_access User.Read"
  }
}
```

#### **Step 3: Set Up .NET 8+ Application for Azure AD Authentication**

1. **Install Required NuGet Packages**:
   Run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web --version 2.8.0
   dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect --version 8.0.0
   dotnet add package Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI --version 2.8.0
   ```

2. **Configure Authentication in Program.cs**:

   Configure the application to use **Azure Entra ID** for authentication and enable token acquisition for APIs:

   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
   using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;

   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

   // Add Azure AD authentication
   builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(builder.Configuration, "AzureAd")
       .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(new string[] { "User.Read" })
       .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

   // Add role-based authorization
   builder.Services.AddAuthorization(options =>
   {
       options.AddPolicy("Admin", policy => policy.RequireRole("Admin"));
       options.AddPolicy("User", policy => policy.RequireRole("User"));
   });

   builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
   builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews();

   var app = builder.Build();

   app.UseHttpsRedirection();
   app.UseStaticFiles();

   app.UseRouting();

   app.UseAuthentication();  // Apply authentication
   app.UseAuthorization();   // Apply authorization

   app.MapRazorPages();      // Use Razor Pages
   app.MapControllers();     // Use Controllers

   app.Run();
   ```

#### **Step 4: Role-Based Authorization**

You can control access to specific routes based on roles assigned in **Azure Entra ID**:

```csharp
[Authorize(Policy = "Admin")]
[HttpGet("admin")]
public IActionResult AdminEndpoint()
{
    return Ok("You are an admin.");
}

[Authorize(Policy = "User")]
[HttpGet("user")]
public IActionResult UserEndpoint()
{
    return Ok("You are a user.");
}
```

#### **Step 5: Deploy to Azure Government Cloud**

1. **Configure Deployment Pipeline**:
   Use **Azure DevOps** or another CI/CD tool to deploy the app to **Azure Government Cloud**.
2. **Azure App Service Configuration**:
   - Ensure that your **appsettings.json** file contains the correct **Client Secret** and **Government Cloud** URLs.
   - Set environment variables for sensitive information (such as **Client Secret**) or use **Azure Key Vault**.

---

## **5. Testing**

- Test the application locally by navigating to protected routes like `/admin` or `/user`.
- Ensure that Azure AD's **MFA** prompts are triggered when users authenticate.
- Verify role-based authorization by assigning different roles to users in Azure AD and testing access to restricted endpoints.

---

## **6. Deliverables**

- **Documentation**: This document serves as a foundational guide for the implementation.
- **Sample Code**: Provide a working codebase configured for Azure Government Cloud.
- **Test Cases**: Ensure test cases cover MFA enforcement and role-based access control.

---

## **7. Next Steps**

1. **Refine and Detail User Stories**:
   - Create detailed user stories based on the documentation to guide implementation.
   - Include stories for app registration, MFA configuration, deployment setup, and Azure AD role management.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Start building the actual solution based on the spike.
   - Assign tasks to team members for different parts of the implementation (authentication, authorization, role management, etc.).
