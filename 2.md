# Scanner SDK Comparison: Dynamsoft vs. ScannerJS

## üìã Overview

This document provides a detailed comparison of **Dynamsoft Web TWAIN** and **Asprise ScannerJS** based on the following categories:

---

## üß© Features

### Dynamsoft
- Image scanning, editing, saving, uploading
- Built-in support for various image formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF, TIFF)
- Multi-page scanning (batch scanning)
- Automatic document border detection
- Blank page removal, barcode recognition, OCR
- Built-in UI viewer with preview, rotate, delete, reorder
- Camera capture (mobile support)
- Customizable UI
- TWAIN, ICA, SANE, WIA support

### ScannerJS (Asprise)
- Basic image scanning and uploading
- Support for image formats (PDF, JPG, PNG, BMP)
- Basic UI with scan/save/upload
- Lighter functionality (no in-browser editing)
- No OCR or barcode built-in
- No advanced UI viewer
- Lower flexibility compared to Dynamsoft

---

## üíª Platform Support

### Dynamsoft
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Mobile**: Android & iOS via camera capture SDK
- **Frameworks**: Angular, React, Vue, Blazor, ASP.NET MVC/Core

### ScannerJS
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Edge (with caveats), Firefox (limited)
- **OS**: Windows only (TWAIN-based)
- **Mobile**: Not supported
- **Frameworks**: Plain JavaScript, partial Angular support (via wrapper)

---

## üíº Licensing

### Dynamsoft
- Commercial license only
- Annual subscription or perpetual model
- Developer-based or server-based pricing
- 30-day free trial available
- Requires license key activation

### ScannerJS
- Commercial license (less expensive)
- One-time developer fee
- Royalty-free redistribution
- No activation required (but registration may be needed)

---

## üîê Security

### Dynamsoft
- HTTPS communication supported
- Secure file upload over HTTPS
- Sandboxed browser environment
- No persistent storage
- Certified digital signatures on installers
- Supports CSP (Content Security Policy) configurations

### ScannerJS
- HTTPS communication supported
- Secure file upload is developer responsibility
- Runs in browser but uses ActiveX for some legacy support
- Less control over scanner security settings
- No OCR/barcode = less data privacy risk, but also fewer features

---

## üîß Override Scanner Settings

### Is Dynamsoft able to override user scanner default settings?
‚úÖ **Yes**. Dynamsoft allows full control over:
- DPI
- Pixel type (B/W, Gray, Color)
- Feeder/duplex settings
- UI visibility
- Auto rotation
- Blank page threshold
- Brightness/contrast

### Is ScannerJS able to override user scanner default settings?
‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially**.
- Limited support for DPI and pixel type
- Cannot reliably override feeder or duplex settings
- Uses default scanner dialog in many cases
- Less flexible compared to Dynamsoft

---

## üöÄ Performance *(Dynamsoft - Out of Scope for Now)*

**Dynamsoft**
- [To be evaluated post full integration]

**ScannerJS**
- Lightweight, fast to load
- Faster startup due to smaller library size
- Performance drops with large scans (e.g., 50+ pages)
- Limited memory management

---

## üîß Ease of Integration *(Dynamsoft - Out of Scope for Now)*

**Dynamsoft**
- [To be evaluated after full implementation]

**ScannerJS**
- Very easy to drop into any HTML page
- API is minimal and fast to learn
- Lacks deeper framework support (manual integration needed in Angular)

---

## üåü Overall Impressions *(Dynamsoft - Out of Scope for Now)*

**ScannerJS**
- Good lightweight tool for basic scanning
- Minimal setup effort
- Poor scalability for enterprise
- Security and scanner control lacking
